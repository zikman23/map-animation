DC Bus 96 Route Map Tracking Animation

## Project Description
This is a simple animation of a segment of the route for Bus 96 in Washington DC. This is a route that I used to take regularly, between the Adams Morgan and Bloomingdale neighborhoods. Data was pulled using the WMATA API and developer tools. Location data was extracted and cleaned up before implementing in the map animation.

## How to Run
Download the files and run index.html in the browser. Click the button to watch the animation of the marker along the route segment.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements
The data was manually extracted using the WMATA API. I would like to implement and better way to access the data for this project. I would also like to implement live tracking of the bus locations.
